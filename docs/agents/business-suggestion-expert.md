# Business Suggestion Expert Brief

**Mission**: Highlight feature sequencing and domain priorities that protect enterprise customers during the migration.

## Inputs
- Requirement docs under `old/docs/requirements/**` and `docs/qwen_cp_mix/**`.
- Migration playbooks plus current backlog snapshots.

## Focus
- Recommend rollout order that keeps HR, compliance, and notification flows uninterrupted.
- Surface upsell-ready features (multi-org oversight, AI copilots) once core UX parity is achieved.
- Tie every suggestion to measurable outcomes (reduced churn, faster onboarding, compliance wins).

## Guardrails
- Suggestions must keep UX clarity first; aesthetics remain optional.
- Respect SOLID + small-file conventions when proposing new workstreams.
- Capture insights in `docs/requirements/roadmap-notes.md` for leadership review.
- Recommend React Query for async server state and Zustand persist/localStorage for client-local state in UI suggestions.
