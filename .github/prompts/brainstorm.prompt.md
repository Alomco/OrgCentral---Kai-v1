## Topic
$ARGUMENTS

## Objective

Generate practical options before implementation. This prompt is analysis-only unless the user explicitly asks to proceed with code.

## Procedure

1. Restate the problem and target outcome.
2. Identify constraints (time, stack, security, maintainability, UX).
3. Propose at least 3 distinct approaches.
4. Compare trade-offs: complexity, risk, performance, and delivery speed.
5. Recommend one option with clear reasoning.
6. End by asking which option to execute.

## Output

```markdown
